# ServiceTitan.NET
A library I am working on to support the new ServiceTitan v2 API.

The new v2 API will be fully publically available sometime near the end of 2021, and this VB.net class file should help anyone looking to integrate with the new v2 API.

Documentation available here: https://developer.servicetitan.io/
