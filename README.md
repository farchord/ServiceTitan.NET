# ServiceTitan.NET
A library I am working on to support the new ServiceTitan v2 API.

The new v2 API will be fully publically available sometime near the end of 2021, and this VB.net class file should help anyone looking to integrate with the new v2 API.

Classes are implemented and I'm currently working on implementing functions.

Here is what is implemented:

- Accounting functions are about 98% done (Pending updates from the Integrations team, look for 'TODO' comments),
- CRM.
- Dispatch
- Equipment Systems
- Inventory
- Job Planning and Management
- Marketing
- Memberships
- Payroll

Left to do: 
- Pricebook
- Sales & Estimates
- Settings
- Task Management
- Telecom
